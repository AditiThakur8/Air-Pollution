# Air Pollution Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** using machine learning models based on environmental and pollutant data. By analyzing features such as particulate matter, temperature, and humidity, the system provides an accurate prediction of air quality to aid in pollution control and public health.

---

## Features
- **Air Quality Prediction**: Predicts AQI with high accuracy.
- **Data Analysis**: Provides insights into factors contributing to air pollution.
- **Scalable Machine Learning Model**: Capable of handling large datasets with high dimensionality.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data preprocessing and manipulation
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning algorithms
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `joblib` for model saving and deployment
- **Development Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Git

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Input Features**: Environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, and pollutant levels (PM2.5, PM10, etc.).
- **Target Variable**: Air Quality Index (AQI).
